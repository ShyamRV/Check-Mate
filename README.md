## üöÄ Features

- üß† **Conversational AI**: Integrated with Gemini API (LLM) for intelligent responses.
- üé§ **Voice Interaction**: Supports real-time voice recognition and text-to-speech feedback.
- üéØ **Object Detection**: Uses OpenCV for human detection to initiate interaction.
- üè´ **Campus Guide**: Offers information about the university, departments, and staff.
- üó∫Ô∏è **Navigation Help**: Guides visitors with directions inside the building.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Custom Commands**: Can be programmed for various actions like opening doors, triggering greetings, etc.
